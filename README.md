# Logistic-Regression-Sonar-Data
This repository contains a simple example of how to build a logistic regression model, and the dataset used. The context of the problem is as follows: a submarine uses sonar to detect objects which can either be a rock (R) or a mine (M). The last column in the .csv file identifies the rows as either R or M.

## Getting started

To get started, open run the following command in your preferred terminal:

```console
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/EA-Mante/Logistic-Regression-Sonar-Data
```

This clones the repo to your computer

To sucessfully run the downloaded notebook:

1. Ensure `sonar_data.csv` is in the same folder as the notebook.
2. Open the notebook and run all cells.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the tutorial:  
"Project 1 : SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python | End To End Python Machine Learning Project (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiz1ORTBGpY)" by Siddhardhan.

Code was typed and adapted by me for learning purposes.
